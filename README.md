HammerJS
===================================
I have to find a better name
-----------------------------------

This is a VMF file viewer in JavaScript, it's supposed to display Hammer map
files using my VMF parser, and three.js. It also uses nw.js for the UI. Right
now no packaged version exists, refer to the nw.js documentation to launch it.

It should be able to display correctly a basic map, but keep in mind this is a
WIP project. Displacements are supported, but the orientation is sometime wrong
for horizontal ones.

It should display the elements with the same color as Hammer (using the
editor.color property), but if a color isn't found it will use a random color
instead (generated by randomColor.js).
