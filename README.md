HammerJS
===================================
I have to find a better name
-----------------------------------

This is a VMF file viewer in JavaScript, it's supposed to display Hammer map
files. It uses my vmf parser, and three.js. To load a map, simply drag the vmf
file in the viewport.

For the moment it only support rectangular brushes. This is because it doesn't
do any plane intersection calculation, I just generate a quad from the 3 points
of the plane instead. But who uses the clipping tool anyway ?

I does support displacements, but with the same limitations as brushes.

It should display the elements in wireframe with the same color as Hammer
(using the editor.color property), but if a color isn't found it will use a
random color instead (generated by randomColor.js).
