HammerJS
===================================
I have to find a better name
-----------------------------------

This is a VMF file viewer in JavaScript, it's supposed to display Hammer map
files. It uses my vmf parser, and three.js. To load a map, simply drag the vmf
file in the viewport.

It should be able to display correctly a basic map, however it doesn't handle
oblique planes very well (the plane intersection calculation tends to generate
too many vertices).

Displacements are supported, but with the same limitations as brushes (and the
orientation is sometime wrong for horizontal ones).

It should display the elements in wireframe with the same color as Hammer
(using the editor.color property), but if a color isn't found it will use a
random color instead (generated by randomColor.js).
